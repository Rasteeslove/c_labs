Eleanor Rigby
0 19192 49 [Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?
Yellow Submarine
0 193628 49 [Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr]
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr]
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Full steam ahead Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!

[Verse 4: Ringo Starr & Paul McCartney]
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us (Everyone of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha-ha!)

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Something
0 27823 34 [Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Here Comes the Sun
0 455667 44 [Intro]
Here comes the sun, doo-dun-doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo-dun-doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 2]
Little darling, the smile's returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

0 158293 33 [Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells
The Great Gig In The Sky
0 2821991 0 Money
0 152637 44 [Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Money, get away
You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

[Saxophone Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise
That they're giving none away

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, ooh...

[Spoken Outro: Interview excerpts]
- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!
- Yes, absolutely in the right!
- I certainly was in the right!
- Yeah, I was definitely in the right; that geezer was cruising for a bruising...
- Yeah
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time...
- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out

0 19191 21 [Verse 1]
Cat's foot, iron claw
Neuro-surgeons scream for more
At paranoia's poison door
Twenty-first century schizoid man

[Verse 2]
Blood rack, barbed wire
Politicians' funeral pyre
Innocents raped with napalm fire
Twenty-first century schizoid man

[Instrumental: "Mirrors"]

[Verse 3]
Death seed, blind man's greed
Poets' starving, children bleed
Nothing he's got he really needs
Twenty-first century schizoid man

The Court of the Crimson King
0 6789 60 [Verse 1]
The rusted chains of prison moons
Are shattered by the sun
I walk a road, horizons change
The tournament's begun
The purple piper plays his tune
The choir softly sing
Three lullabies in an ancient tongue

[Refrain]
For the court of the crimson king, aah
Aah, aah

[Verse 2]
The keeper of the city keys
Put shutters on the dreams
I wait outside the pilgrim's door
With insufficient schemes
The black queen chants the funeral march
The cracked brass bells will ring
To summon back the fire witch

[Refrain]
To the court of the crimson king, aah
Aah, aah

[Instrumental Bridge]
Aah, aah
Aah, aah

[Verse 3]
The gardener plants an evergreen
Whilst trampling on a flower
I chase the wind of a prism ship
To taste the sweet and sour
The pattern juggler lifts his hand
The orchestra begin
As slowly turns the grinding wheel

[Refrain]
In the court of the crimson king, aah
Aah, aah

[Flute Solo: "The Return of the Fire Witch"]

[Verse 4]
On soft gray mornings widows cry
The wise men share a joke
I run to grasp divining signs
To satisfy the hoax
The yellow jester does not play
But gently pulls the strings
And smiles as the puppets dance

[Refrain]
In the court of the crimson king, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
